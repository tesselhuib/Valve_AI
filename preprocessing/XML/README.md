This directory contains the code to convert XML to PDF or to NPZ. For this internship project the UK Biobank database was used, which contains ECGs saved in XML format. To process these in a VAE, conversion to npz was needed. The following package was used, with some modifications to handle XML instead of DICOM: https://gitlab.com/SchmidtAF/ECGProcess.

The main modification is in the __call__() function of the ECGXMLReader() class to process XML instead of DICOM. Also, a write_numpy() function in the ECGDICOMTable() class was added. Next to that, two additions were made. One, was the inclusion of the check_all_ecg_leads_threshold() function in the ECGDrawing() class to remove ecgs of which one or more leads had more than 10% of samples with an absolute value > 1.5 mV. These ECGs were suspected of motion artefacts and therefore not included in the pretraining of the VAE. The second addition is that of the check whether a Median Waveform was present, if it was not present the ECG recording failed and therefore these ECGs were not included either.
