This directory contains the code to convert DICOM to PDF or to NPZ. For this internship project data from Amsterdam UMC was used, which contains ECGs saved in DICOM format. To process these, conversion to npz was needed. The following package was used, with some modifications to convert to npz instead of pdf: https://gitlab.com/SchmidtAF/ECGProcess. 

The main modification is the addition of a write_numpy() function in the ECGDICOMTable() class. Next to that, two additions were made. One, was the inclusion of the check_all_ecg_leads_threshold() function in the ECGDrawing() class to remove ecgs of which one or more leads had more than 10% of samples with an absolute value > 1.5 mV. These ECGs were suspected of motion artefacts and therefore not included in the pretraining of the VAE and not converted. The second addition is that of the check whether a Median Waveform was present before converting to pdf or npz, if it was not present the ECG recording failed and therefore these ECGs were not converted either.
